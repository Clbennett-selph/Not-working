List of ten good games!

1) Stellaris: A game that allows you to control a space empire and deal with 1-3 seperate end game crises.

2) Age of empires 2: An old game that allows you to play through historical battles. Has old graphics, but the game is still overall a very
great experience.

3) Halo Series: I enjoy the entirety of the halo series for many reasons. The main conflict is between humanity and an alien empire
called the covenant.

4) Dark souls: A game series that have perfected the pure feeling of "Get good or Get out". This game is rage inducing, but somehow is 
still very fun to play.

5) Fire emblem series: A series of turn based games that require you to think ahead.

6) They are billions: A zombie defense game that perfects the feeling of "My base is in danger!Aaaahhhh!

7) Skyrim: It just works, it just works!

8) Star wars battlefront 2 (Old verison): A classic star wars game where you play as classic star wars teams :l

9)Supreme commander: A great game where you can play as 1 of 3 - 4 teams (depending on your DLC)

10) Terraria: A 2D minecraft that has more content, and is just as fun as the former game.
